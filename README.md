Shifts is a framework for composing autonomous **agent** workflows, using a mixture of LLM backends.

- 🤖 **Automate your chores** - have AI agents handle the mundane so you can focus on the things you care about.
- 💪🏻 **Agents with superpowers** - create tools, so your agents can interact with the Web or internal APIs and systems.
- 🧩 **Flexible and adaptable** - easily compose and modify workflows to suit your specific needs.
- 🤗 **Delightful simplicity** - pipe instructions together using just plain English and intuitive APIs.
- 🎨 **Mix and match** - Plug into different LLMs even within the same workflow so you are always using the right tool for job.
